There's an IDAPro plug-in that comes with Ghidra that you can use to spit out an .xml file that Ghidra will read in to get all the names.

It feels like double-clicking the address is supposed to do something special, not just highlight it (?), like take you to the startup sequence which you are then supposed to mark as code. However, the address is just text and doesn't &quot;take&quot; me anywhere. It's not a XREF and &quot;jump to operand&quot; doesn't work.<br /><br />And trying to mark those 8 characters as code with the &quot;c&quot; key doesn't work either &quot;Command 'MakeCode' Failed&quot;.<br /><br />Screenshot of what I'm talking about&#058;<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://imgur.com/a/uJxr2PY">https://imgur.com/a/uJxr2PY</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Looked for video tutorials and found none.<br /><br />No clue what to do at this point.<br /><br />Already ordered a new fuel pump and probably don't need to actually find the FPDC tables, but really want to be able to reverse-engineer ROMs since I have multiple open-source tuned Subarus.<br /><br />Thanks if anyone can help give a clue here!<br /><br />EDIT: If I highlight the entire row including the blanks and hit C, it prompts to do an analysis and prompts to clear existing data, then seems to return the view to the original (before changing with the D key).

I've used both and I find Ghidra far superior IMHO.<br /><br />Not 100% sure but it looks like you might have the endian-ness the wrong way round? The first four bytes should become an address 0x00000B68. But that image is showing 0x680B0000 (ie: the reverse). When you double click it, it looks for an address 0x680B0000, which doesn't exist, so nothing happens. Subaru SuperH ROMs are 'big endian'<br /><br />At address 0x00000B68 you will find the entry function in your ROM. Go there and press 'C' and it should turn into code (unless the wrong endian-ness causes more problems).

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thank you for posting this thread; there is a lot that is not clear to someone beginning to learn assembly/disassembly. This thread has given me renewed hope in my endeavor.<br /><br />I have an interest in learning how the machine code in my Motorola MC68376 processor functions. When I began I didn't know anything about assembly language or disassembly. In order to learn assembly (because I did not want to purchase IDA since it is expensive and my lack of knowledge would preclude its effective use), I decided to write my own disassembler. I found documentation for the 68000 and the individual processor's machine instructions and have written a simple script which looks for the first exception table (which shows where the code begins) and linearly translates code from there on (accounting for branching possibilities).<br /><br />On short examples of code posted online (and in the snippets from this processor/application which others have translated using IDA), I can get a perfect match in disassembly of commands on the first run through the file. Unfortunately, I don't yet know how to handle data types and tables, so these are incorrectly translated into instructions. My end goal is to understand a file with something like a million bytes, so there is a lot of room for error. I'm sure you're all familiar with this.<br /><br />At first, I was quite disappointed that I could not get the full disassembly with a single pass. After seeing this thread, and realizing that not even IDA can do such a feat, I can adjust my disassembly strategy based upon how you use IDA to disassemble binary files.<br /><br />I will certainly share more of what I've done if anyone is interested; I would benefit greatly from a conversation about disassembly and how code is organized in memory.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately, the link you provided leads to a 404 error when trying to download the 68k binutils for MinGW (what I'm most familiar with). I already have the binutils that come with the MinGW implementation of gcc, but I assume that it does not have the m68k instructions built in.<br /><br />Even still, I'm not sure how to properly use that. I guess I could try to use the objdump to get binutils to disassemble for me, right?<br /><br />Alternately, I could try to figure out how to use the BDM interface on the board (using the tools in that link).. but I was hoping I would not have to pry off the sealed lid from the ECU.

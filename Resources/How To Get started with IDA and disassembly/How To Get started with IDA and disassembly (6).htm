I suspect IDA version differences may make them unusable to some people.  Especially if they are created with a non-legal IDA version.  So there's two issues to sort out.</div><br /><br />I can definitely see some version issues happening. Another avenue I'm going to look into is .MAP dumps, which are very 'generic', but I don't think it is as 'plug and play' as a .IDC or .IDB. I've got a program running between .MAP dumps and HEW, such that defining a patch for a new ECU is (for the most part) all done in IDA, with no repetitive or manual address copying involved.. It would be a good scripting exercise to have it convert to an IDC. I'll be posting app well when I clean it up a bit.<br /><br />As for the copyright, I'm thinking it isn't a problem. Because ecuflash and cobb solutions both involve breaking encryption and seed/key protocols, this tells me that either A: the copyright holders don't care, or B: It's perfectly legal to do so. Both of which would mean sharing the code shouldn't be an issue.

But I would like to. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" class="reimg" /> <br /><br />You can try pressing 'c' to mark non-code sections as code. If it really was code, that usually works well. Other times it will just find one or two opcodes and then give up because the next two bytes are illegal. You can also re-do the analysis pass after you've manually labeled more sections as code. That will usually help it find more code on its own.<br /><br />I think the issue is that there are chunks of code that are never executed directly from the core code. For example, interrupt routines. The CPU will interrupt whatever is running and jump to those routines based on the interrupt handler vector. It would be handy to have a way to tell IDA &quot;here's an array of pointers to code, please disassemble the code at each address.&quot; That's probably something that could be done from an IDC script, but I haven't tried it.

		<td colspan="2"><hr class="sep" />So... I've taken the red pill, and started disassembling 16bit roms as well.  Man, steep learning curve.<br /><br />So - I'm looking for some tips on how to speed things up - I've got the basic table structures down, and how the addressing works for tables and Ram - is there a quicker way to have IDA automatically convert addresses, as opposed to having to add the 0x2 (for Z0) in front of every address?  Damn tedious.<br /><br />E.g. in A4SHC00H (my test rom), I've pulled out quite a couple of tables already - for the 'lookup' (table type) for Base Timing, A0D8h is referenced in the code.  Is there a non-manual way to get to the correct address (i.e. 2A0D8)?<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">ROM:1DEDC loc_1DEDC:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; CODE XREF: sub_1DDE6+D2j<br />ROM:1DEDC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; sub_1DDE6+E0j ...<br />ROM:1DEDC&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ste&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0C09h, Z&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; Store E<br />ROM:1DEE0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ldy&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#0A0D8h&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; Load IY<br />ROM:1DEE4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;brclr&nbsp; &nbsp;56h, Z, #20h, loc_1D</div>
